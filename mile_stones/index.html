      <h2>The Birth of the IBM PC</h2>

     <div class="body">
     <p>IBM launched its personal computer in August 1981.  only a year after corporate executives gave the go-ahead to Bill Lowe, the lab director in the company's Boca Raton, Fla., facilities. He set up a task force that developed the proposal for the first IBM PC. Early studies had concluded that there were not enough applications to justify acceptance on a broad basis and they were fighting the idea that things couldn't be done quickly in IBM. While IBM’s PC was not the first, others had been available since the 1970s, its version became incredibly popular and for many it set the standards of what a PC should be. Costing $1,565, the IBM 5150 had 40K of read-only memory and 16K of user memory. Other features included a built-in speaker and the ability to run self-diagnostic checks. It also made use of Microsoft’s MS-DOS 1.0, a 16-bit operating system.</p>

     <h2> Microsoft launches Windows</h2>
     <p> Windows 1.0 was launched to market in November 1985 as an operating system with a graphical interface. While Microsoft originally promised that Windows would allow for overlapping windows, this feature didn’t make it to release. Instead, all windows were tiled and only dialog boxes could appear over other windows. The first few iterations of Windows were also not fully-fledged operating systems, but rather shells that ran atop MS-DOS. Windows 1.0 was notable because it relied heavily on use of a mouse before the mouse was a common computer input device. To help users become familiar with this odd input system, Microsoft included a game, Reversi that relied on mouse control, not the keyboard, to get people used to moving the mouse around and clicking onscreen elements and know today everyone uses a mouse with their computer. Today, the latest versions of Windows are used by millions of people all over the world.</p>

     <h2>The World Wide Web</h2> 
     <p>In 1989 British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee submitted a proposal for a “distributed information system” at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, near Geneva, Switzerland. A year later, the world’s first website and server went live at CERN. info.cern.ch was the address of the world's first website and Web server, running on a NeXT computer at CERN. The first Web page address was http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html.The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world. The WWW design allowed easy access to existing information and an early web page linked to information useful to CERN scientists (e.g. the CERN phone book and guides for using CERN’s central computers). A search facility relied on keywords - there were no search engines in the early years.  In addition, it included the ability to modify pages from directly inside the browser – the first Web editing capability</p>

     <h2>The Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation</h2>
      <p>Launched within weeks of each other in 1994, the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation consoles blazed a trail in the video gaming industry. While the PlayStation has outlasted the Saturn through multiple iterations, including today’s PlayStation 4, both consoles had a significant impact and influence on home entertainment. Unlike the Super Nintendo, Sega Mega Drive and other similar consoles, games for the Saturn and PlayStation came on CDs rather than cartridges. The consoles had enough power inside to showcase games including the visually stunning “Nights into Dreams” on the Saturn and “Final Fantasy VII,” an in-depth role-playing game on the PlayStation. Sony had spent 1994 on a global charm offensive. The company’s chief system designer, Ken Kutaragi, visited developers all over the world, bringing an impressive set of graphics demos and promising a wealth of cool development tools and favorable production deals. Sega meanwhile, had been confusing and alienating its audience and development community with a string of add-ons for the hugely successful (but increasingly dated) Mega Drive, and a wealth of promises about new hardware platforms that never materialized. Sony had one product and one message: PlayStation is the future.</p>

     <h2>The ENICAC</h2>
     <p>The ENIAC was developed by John Prosper Eckert and John W. Mauchly, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, or ENIAC, was built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. Described by the university as the “first general-purpose electronic computer,” ENIAC’s “operational characteristics” included memory and arithmetic. In 1942, the physicist John Mauchly proposed an all-electronic calculating machine. The U.S. Army, meanwhile, needed to calculate complex wartime ballistics tables. Proposal met patron. The result was ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), built between 1943 and 1945—the first large-scale computer to run at electronic speed without being slowed by any mechanical parts. For a decade, until a 1955 lightning strike, ENIAC may have run more calculations than all mankind had done up to that point.</p>
